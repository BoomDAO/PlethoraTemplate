## UNITY TEMPLATE

This ***Plethora Template*** has all the necessary code for modding its first minigame (Meme Monster Pop). You will be able to swap, remove, add assets, and tweek the configurations of the "Meme Monster Pop" minigame. Plethora Template fully relies on the Boom Dao technology to achieve on-chain login authentication, payments, minting, burning, action system, entity datastore, white-label shop, and white-label NFT marketplace. We designed this template to facilitate the learning process of building a fully on-chain game with Boom Dao and ICP technology and to showcase the potential for modding games with Boom Dao technology.
